                <h3>What is Skateboarding?</h3>
                <p><br></p>
                <p id="content">Skateboarding was invented in California
                    sometime in the late 1940s by surfers who wanted something
                    to do when there were no waves. A skateboad is made with
                    multiple parts: a deck, trucks, wheels, bearings, hardware,
                    and griptape which allow you to ride it.</p>

                <p>The best time to skate is any time, except for
                    when there is heavy rain. The only way to get better at
                    skateboarding is to ride it. More time spent riding your
                    skateboard equals you being better at riding your
                    skateboard. If you can, ride your skateboard to work,
                    school, or to hang out with friends. While skating with
                    others tends to be more fun it is perpectly normal to skate
                    alone.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Some people may feel that they are too young/old
                    or some other excuse to not start skating, but there is no
                    wrong time to start skating. You can find stories of many
                    people online who starting skateboarding in their 30s and
                    40s. If skateboarding looks like fun to you then I suggest
                    you get a skateboard and try it out.</p>

                <p>The safest places to skate are skate
                    parks and normal parks. At skate parks you have the
                    potiential of meeting other skaters who you can
                    learn from and make friends with. Normal parks are
                    also good places to skate when starting out. All you
                    need in the beginning is a small patch of asphault
                    or concrete.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Other skaters prefer to skate on the
                    street or what's known as "Street Skating". This
                    involves skating down normal street roads. Street
                    skating is more dangerous than skating in a park
                    because you have the natural dangers of being on the
                    street, but also the obstacles you are trying to
                    skate over are not made with skating in mind. Also
                    you run the risk of getting involved with law
                    enforcement as some places do not allow skaters on
                    their property. </p>

                <p>To ride a skateboard put your
                    front foot on the skateboard over or
                    slightly behind the front bolts, make sure
                    too point your foot straight or at a slight
                    angle. Then push the ground with your
                    opposite foot to propel you forward on the
                    board. After pushing place your back foot on
                    the board and get into riding stance. You
                    can then lean forward and backward to
                    turn.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>This is a very simple
                    explanation of how to ride a skateboard. I
                    would reccomend going online and trying to
                    find some videos or articles talking about
                    the basics of skateboarding to give you some
                    more help. It can make learning how to ride
                    skateboards a lot easier if you can see
                    someone do it. If you have any friends that
                    skate ask them to go ride with you and ask
                    for tips.</p>

                <p>Skateboarding is a fun
                    and unique way to get around.
                    Skating can also be a fun hobby to
                    do at the park. It is the same as
                    enjoying riding motorcycles or
                    driving muscle cars. If skating
                    looks fun to you then give it a try.
                    It could be something that you grow
                    to really enjoy. </p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>Don't worry about
                    looking like a beginner. Everyone
                    didn't know how to skate when they
                    first started. It can be hard and
                    you will be tempted to stop, but if
                    skating is something you enjoy then
                    you will stick with it and get
                    better over time.</p>

                <p>My name is Nathaniel
                    Hayes and I am the creator of this
                    website. This website was made for
                    an assignment in my web app design
                    and development class. The
                    assignment was to make a multi-paged
                    website using a single html file.
                    The topic for the website is any
                    hobby or actvity I find interesting.
                    I recently picked up skateboarding
                    as a hobby, so I chose that to be
                    the theme of this website.</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>I recently got my first
                    skateboard. I have been learning
                    with one of my friends and it has
                    been a cool experience so far. While
                    I am still very new to this I am
                    enjoying skateboarding and the
                    challenges it poses. I would
                    reccomend anyone that is courious
                    about skateboarding to give it a
                    try.</p>
