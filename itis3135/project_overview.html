      <h2>Project Overview</h2>
      <p>1. My application will consist of modules that teach some basic Java concepts.</p>
      <p>2. The intented users of this website are the client the website was made for, as well as anyone wanting to learn how to program using Java.</p>
      <p>3. The content of the website consists of modules that will teach the user a concept in Java. While working through the modules there will an area for the user to type some code based on the conept being taught. </p>

      <h3>Dynamic Functionality: </h3>
      <p>The website will have dynamic headers and footers. I also plan to validate text entered from the user to answer questions placed throughout the modules. </p>
      <p>A website that has similar functionality to what I want to implement is <a href="https://www.learnjavaonline.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21">learnjavaonline.org</a>.</p>
